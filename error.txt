I'm using GCC 12.3.0 and C++ 20 and VS Code. 


The first application made in the video I watched to learn C++ was the following:

#include <iostream>

int main(){
    auto result = (10 <-> 20) > 0;
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

I got an error like this:

PS C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\cpp> cd "c:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\cpp\" ; if ($?) { g++ main.cpp -o main } ; if ($?) { .\main }
main.cpp: In function 'int main()':

    4 |     auto result = (10 <-> 20) > 0;
      |                        ^~

      |                          )


Solution: For those who encounter an annoying error like this at the very beginning of the learning process, there is a workaround. Replacing the <-> operator with >.

I don't understand why I can't use the <=> ("spaceship", three-way comparison) operator even though I'm using current versions. If anyone knows the root cause of this problem, please write. For now, I'm preparing a note like this so that I don't forget.
